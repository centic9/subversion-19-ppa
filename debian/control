Description: Advanced version control system
 Apache Subversion, also known as svn, is a centralised version control
 system.  Version control systems allow many individuals (who may be
 distributed geographically) to collaborate on a set of files (source
 code, websites, etc).  Subversion began with a CVS paradigm and
 supports all the major features of CVS, but has evolved to support
 many features that CVS users often wish they had.
 .
 This package includes the Subversion client (svn), repository
 administration tools (svnadmin, svnlook) and a network server (svnserve).

  * svn-fast-backup: rsync-based backup script for FSFS repositories
  * svn-hot-backup: Backup script, primarily for BDB repositories
  * svn_apply_autoprops: Apply property settings from
    .subversion/config file to an existing repository
  * svn_load_dirs: Sophisticated replacement for 'svn import'
  * svnwrap: Set umask to 002 before calling svn or svnserve
  * fsfs-access-map: Convert strace output into FSFS access map
  * several example hook scripts: commit-access-control, commit-email,
    log-police, mailer, svnperms, verify-po

 change radically or disappear in future releases.  Some of these
 scripts require packages on the Recommends list.
