  [ Peter Samuelson ]
  * New upstream version.  (Closes: #621692, #656966)
    - Refresh patches; remove obsolete no-dbus-spam, kwallet-wid,
      perl-warning, perl-compiler-flags, po, swig2-compat,
      disable-failing-tests, python-exception-syntax
    - Split patches/apr-abi into apr-abi1 (to be submitted) and
      apr-abi2 (Debian-specific).
    - Disable patches/ruby-test-info ... for now.
    - Requires serf 1.0 or higher.
  * Upstream no longer ships contrib in tarball:
    - Remove contrib-license-audit
    - subversion-tools now Recommends: svn2cl
    - Ship svn-clean, svn-fast-backup, svn_apply_autoprops,
      svn_load_dirs, commit-email.pl in debian/contrib
    - Don't ship svnmerge.py, it has outlived its usefulness
    - Delete patches/{svn2cl-*,svn-clean-ignore,commit-email}
    - Overhaul debian/copyright
  * rules: Specify that we want our own libtool.  Otherwise it finds the
    one from /usr/share/apr-1.0/build, which doesn't support C++.
  * patches/entropy: Remove as obsolete.  It was a workaround for apr
    using /dev/random, but apr switched to /dev/urandom in 1.3.
  * Move emacs plugins from subversion to subversion-tools.
  * patches/java-osgi-metadata: Add OSGi metadata to the libsvn-java
    jarfile.  Thanks Jakub Adam.  (Closes: #644438)
  * Switch from python-support to dh_python2.
  * patches/python-swig205: New patch: Adjust for swig 2.0.5+ handling of
    Python ints vs. longs.

  [ Michael Diers ]
  * More contrib adjustments:
    - Provide debian/contrib/emacs from upstream VCS contrib/client-side/emacs
    - Add svn_1.6_releasenotes.html, svn_1.7_releasenotes.html
    - subversion.docs, subversion.install

      If anyone _needs_ multiarch for Java libraries, which I doubt, we
      should come up with a way to produce deterministic jar files.
    - Reintroduce specific db dependencies, so a random binNMU can't
      change the DB version without warning.
  * Disable serf support for now, as this release won't properly work with
    serf 1.0.
  * patches/g++47: New patch to build with g++ 4.7.

  * Loosen dependencies between subversion-tools and the other packages,
    as the one is "Architecture: all" and the others are not.
  * Build-Conflict with swig 1.3.28 and newer, to document reality.  This
    has been addressed by upstream trunk but not yet backported.
  * patches/neon-0.25.5.patch: new patch from upstream, to allow compiling
    with neon 0.25.5.

  [ Peter, Guilherme ]
  * New upstream version. (Closes: #344819)
    - Undeprecates svnserve -R (Closes: #341438)
    - Fixes typo in locks/db-logs.lock (Closes: #339298)
    - README does not mention bdb specifics when using fsfs (Closes: #295860)
    - Seems to not crash on deep directory checkouts with certain kernels.
      (Closes: #348327)
    - Back to a pristine upstream tar, as upstream has removed the
      (non-free) Subversion Book.
    - All patches rediffed / ported.
      - no_extra_libs, svn_load_dirs_symlinks: renamed to no-extra-libs,
        svn_load_dirs-symlinks, for consistency.
      - commit-email-warning, l10n-segfault: Removed (fixed upstream).

  [ Peter Samuelson ]
  * New packages libsvn-ruby1.8 and dummy libsvn-ruby.  (Closes: #335987)
    - patches/ruby-no-strict-aliasing.patch: new patch.
    - patches/ruby-swig-1.3.27.patch: new patch from upstream, to
      build with SWIG 1.3.27.  Upstream says this is still unofficial.
  * Disable java on kfreebsd-i386.  (Closes: #345196)
  * patches/bash_completion.patch: new patch to fix minor wildcard
    breakage with bash completion.  (Closes: #342052)
  * rules: remove x bit from /etc/bash_completion.d/subversion.
    Thanks, lintian.
  * control: downgrade db4.3-util to Suggests.
  * Move README.db4.3 and the corresponding NEWS entry to the libsvn0
    package.  Leave a symlink in /usr/share/doc/subversion/.
    (Closes: #342235)
  * README.db4.3: add notes about preserving file permissions.
    Thanks to Ross Boylan.  (Closes: #345819)

    the svn_load_dirs contrib script.  Thanks to Tilman Koschnick.
    (Closes: #311440, #319165)
  * rules: cleanups:
    - Use debhelper -s instead of -a, and -i -s instead of -A.
      This would have prevented the need for 1.2.3dfsg1-2.
    - Move some build rules out of the 'install' target.
    - Enable additional tests (make check-swig-py).
    - Drop use of 'time' (and corresponding build-dep in control).
  * control: move from libneon24 to libneon25, as upstream now prefers.
  * patches/no-extra-libs-2.patch: new patch: more spurious-link pruning.

  * rules: Remove the unwritten requirement that /usr/bin/python be
    specifically version 2.3:
    - derive python version from debian/control, not from dpkg -l
    - pass PYTHON=python2.3 explicitly into configure
  * rules: clean rule: Seek and destroy _all_ *.pyc files.  There were
    a few we didn't catch before, buried in the testsuite.
  * Remove various unneeded files from language bindings (Closes: #310777)
    - libsvn-core-perl.install: don't install /usr/lib/*.{a,la,so}
    - python2.3-subversion.install: likewise
    - libsvn-javahl.install: don't install /usr/lib/jni/*.{a,la}
    - rules: delete *.{a,la} from python2.3/site-packages/libsvn
  * control: build-depends on libapr0-dev (>= 2.0.55-3).
    Earlier versions of libapr0 will try to make us link to libdb4.2.
  * subversion.NEWS, README.db4.3: document db4.2 -> db4.3 upgrade.
  * patches/no_extra_libs.patch: new patch to prevent linking to several
    unneeded libraries.  (Closes: #336373, which was caused by linking to
    libssl0.9.8.)
    - debian/control: Remove several depends and build-depends we are no
      longer using because of this
  * patches/commit-email-warning.patch: new patch to eliminate a harmless
    warning in a hook script.  (Closes: #336781)
  * patches/perl-test-clean.patch: new patch to avoid leaving several
    /tmp/svn-perl-test-xxxxxx dirs.
  * patches/swig-1.3.27-hack.patch: new patch to avoid FTBFS from bad
    interaction of swig 1.3.27 and <apr.h>.  A *really* ugly hack.

  [ Adam Conrad ]
  * Switch to using DB4.3 instead of DB4.2, as libapr0 has

  * Changing the default behavior to not use apr_generate_random_bytes(),
    Debian use the system APR which is configured to use /dev/random. In cases

    - changed section of libsvn-javahl to devel
    - bump to Standards-Version 3.6.2.1 with no changes
  * debian/rules:
    - minor cleanups
    - removed remnants of control auto-generation

  [ Peter Samuelson ]
  * Re-repack orig tarball to eliminate the tar-in-tar arrangement
  * debian/rules: adjust to build without the tar-in-tar
    - configure and build in ./BUILD
    - 'clean' removes ./BUILD and files from autogen.sh
    - adjust a lot of installation source paths
    - pass both DEB_SRCDIR and DEB_BUILDDIR into debian/tools/Makefile
  * debian/tools/Makefile: support separate src and build dirs
  * debian/rules: modernise use of debhelper
    - use dh_install instead of dh_movefiles
    - move pathnames out of rules, into *.install, *.dirs, *.docs, *.examples
    - side effect (but correct): move libsvn_swig_* from libsvn0{,-dev}
      to python2.3-subversion and libsvn-core-perl
    - install Java libraries to /usr/lib/jni, not /usr/lib (Closes: #327789)
  * debian/rules, debian/control: disable libsvn-javahl on arm, armeb,
    mips, mipsel, on advice from Jeroen van Wolffelaar.  It seems kaffe
    may remain broken on these architectures for a while.  (Closes: #329184)
  * debian/rules: rip out "architectures to run full testsuite on" logic,
    on advice from Steve Langasek.  It is not safe to assume that
    debian-specific changes to an upstream release will never cause test
    failures.  Local admins can still use DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=notest to
    speed up a local compile.
  * debian/control: relax all versioned build-deps; all the versions are
    satisfied in sarge (and most of them in woody).
  * debian/rules, debian/subversion-tools.{postinst,postrm,install}:
    - move /usr/lib/subversion to /usr/share/subversion (Closes: #330824)
    - move hot-backup.py to /usr/share/doc/subversion/examples
    - create compat symlink /usr/lib/subversion
  * debian/control: remove pkg-subversion-maintainers from Uploaders - it's
    not the right place to document the existence of a list
  * debian/control, debian/rules: build with kaffe-pthreads specifically
    (works around a FTBFS with kaffe 1.1.6)

  [ Guilherme de S. Pastore ]
  * New upstream release (Closes: #320417)
    - tarball repackaged without svnbook, as it's licensed under
      a non-DFSG-free license (Closes: #215083, #218185, #314154)
    - fixes export segmentation fault with versioned items in
      "deleted" state (Closes: #314381, #316133, #316227, #320572, #324037)

    - dropped build-dependency on quilt
    - bump to Standards-Version 3.6.2 with no changes

  * debian/subversion.doc-base.book:

  * debian/README.Debian:
    - Removed; was doing the work of a package description, and
      mentioned the (removed) svnbook
  * debian/python2.3-subversion.README.Debian:
    - Renamed from pythonX.Y-subversion.README.Debian, we longer
      use that auto-generation stuff
  * debian/rules:
    - tiny fixes to unbreak the build process
    - include simple-patchsys.mk from CDBS instead of using quilt;
      it was too complex for our needs
    - fixed detection of tarballs, as to not get confused by CDBS
      auto-generated lists, which would cause the build to fail
    - no longer do any magic to auto-generate debian/control and
      python related documentation; too complex for too little gain
    - set LANG to C, otherwise the build may fail because of tests
      failing for not being able to recognize strings returned by
      some tools
    - no longer do any magic to support builds on pre-sarge
      environments; the package is already complex enough without
      supporting old cruft unnecessarily
  * Removed packaging documentation, as it was pretty much outdated
  * Removed maintenance scripts from the package; left them
    on the 'tools' section of the repository on svn.debian.org

      most rpaths)
  * debian/lintian-overrides: new file for binary package overrides
  * debian/rules:
    - support DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=noopt
    - invent a DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=notest to disable the test suite more

    - the INSTALL file is redundant, do not install it in /usr/share/doc
    - change #!/usr/bin/env python to #!/usr/bin/python2.3 in assorted

  * Depend on exim4 rather than exim. (closes: #255363)
  * Link libsvn_swig_perl-1.so with all the libraries it depends on.
    (closes: #262025)
  * Update neon build-dep to >= 0.24.7.
  * Update apache build-dep to >= 2.0.50.
  * Refresh debian/patches/repos-templates.patch.
  * Add build-dep on libkrb5-dev.
  * Fix permissions on libsvn-core-perl shared libraries.
  * Only remove modules from apache's configuration when we are
    removing libapache2-svn, not on upgrades. (closes: #251245)
    Additionally, move the module config manipulation from the postrm
    to the prerm.  This way there is no time when apache is configured
    to load a module that is not present on the system.

subversion (1.0.2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix apache modules link in a cleaner way.  Previously I had some
    hard-coded link lines in debian rules.  The present change modfies the
    subversion build system itself to hopefully do the right thing in all
    cases.  This change is less invasive and should allow all archs to
    build.  (closes: #246903)

  * cvs2svn is no longer part of this package, request for package filed,
    see http://bugs.debian.org/237934 .

  * Apply changes up to the current head of the 1.0.x branch. 
    This line is making its way to become 1.0.1 which is expected

              http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/branches/1.0.x@8939 
    - Fix directory walk ordering on filesystems that don't return
    '.' first.  (closes: #231364)
    - Many other fixes.
  * Fix description of the subversion book (it is a version control,
    not a revision control system)
  * Remove local copy of patchsys-quilt.mk and add version to quilt build-dep.
  * Don't strip binaries if 'nostrip' is in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
  * Patch from Erno Kuusela to 50vc-svn.el so subversion vc backend doesn't
    supersede an existing default.
  * Don't ship .pyc files in pythonX.Y-subversion.  These files should instead
    be generated in the postinst. (closes: #236170)
  * Detect if debian/control is invalid.  If invalid then recreate it and
    exit failure telling the user to try again.  (closes: #204253)
  * Add debian/shlibs.local which needs to stay around until #231659
    is fixed (closes: #234932).
  * Fix broken stamp files that were among other things making the build
    execute the configure and autogen rules unnecessarily.
  * Update to policy 3.6.1 (no changes).

    - Remove cvs2svn manpage.
  * Fix formatting of NEWS.Debian. (closes: #232940)
  * Put version in shlibs file.  In the last upload I removed all version
    info from the shlibs file rather than converting = to >=.
  * Enable testsuite on many archs.
  * Build with srcdir == builddir.  This fixes some problems in the
    perl bindings and generally makes the build system cleaner.
  * Remove svnadmin-static.  With the build system changes it wasn't 
    easy to keep it and we won't need it for a while if ever.

  * Include README and HACKING. (closes: #218052)
  * Mention to abbreviation 'svn' in short package descriptions.
    (closes: #231698)
  * shlibs file now creates a >= dependancy rather than a strict =.

  * Don't include svnshell.  It is just an example of how to use the 
    bindings and isn't for general consumption. (closes: #230534)
  * New package libsvn-core-perl. (closes: #208935)
  * Fix doc build by giving the new path to the docbook stylesheets.
    (closes: #231981)
  * Start using 'quilt' and part of 'cdbs' to maintain separate pataches
    within the source package.
  * Fix default repos templates. (closes: #210901)
  * Update swig build-dep to >= 1.3.21.  This isn't actually required
    by Subversion but I have some current Subversion bug reports that
    indicate mixing 1.3.19 builds with 1.3.21 systems may cause problems.
  * Pass fulll path the swig to configure so as to ensure we use the swig
    from the Debian package.
  * Don't pass broken CFLAGS to swig wrapper build (closes: #232591)

    again (closes: #230955)

    - svnserve ssh now accepts user@host (closes: #202885)
  * Rebuild against new libapr. (closes: #230311)
  * doc build has changed since the last release, update so it still builds.
  * Add build-conflicts against broken libtool 1.5-6.
  * Don't build book since the source distribution already provides
    us with a built book.
  * Build with Berkeley DB 4.2.
  * Increase required apache2 version to 2.0.48-7 so we build with the
    same version of Berkeley DB.
  * No longer install binaries that include debug symbols.
  * Autogenerated cruft is no longer part of the source package's diff.
  * Update debian/copyright notice for 2004.
  * The default /etc/subversion/config and /etc/subversion/servers are now
    generated as part of the build.
  * Link libsvn_swig_py properly. (closes: #220107)
  * Remove note from debian/control saying that this is an alpha release.

  * Change build dependancy from apache2-devb to apache2-threaded-dev.
  * Remove hack to get around broken apr-config now that bug #197685 is
    fixed.
  * Build depend on docbook-xsl rather than docbook-xsl-stylesheets.
    (closes: #220788)
  * Now that neon 0.24.4 is available increase build dependancy to require
    it.  Subversion itself doesn't require the new version but there are
    enough bug fixes in that version of neon that it is better to use it.
  * Enable mod_dav_fs in libapache2-svn.postinst (closes: #219620)
  * Fix propchange-email.pl and commit-access-control.pl interpreter
    (closes: #220692)
  * Corrent python invocation in svnperms.py.
  * Update /etc/subversion/{config,servers}
  * Update debian/copyright. Re-sync with current upstream license (remove
    reference to expat-lite, add reference to apr-util).  Fix download
    URL to point only to http://subversion.tigris.org rather than trying
    to show the exact URL since that can change.

  * Remove Matt Kraai from Uploaders field. Thanks for all the help 
    Matt! 
  * Wrote debian/tools/svn-make-config.c which is a tool that helps to

    somehow.  Update /etc/subversion/{config,servers}
  * Include svnadmin-static manpage.

subversion (0.30.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adjust dynamic linker search path and location of svnversion 
    binary so the book build doesn't generate a spurious error message.
    As a bonus the version number in the built doc should be correct
    now instead of saying 'Draft'.
  * Set XSL_DIR when building the docs so we can find things like
    docbook.xsl. It appears as though this succeeded when I built 
    0.30.0-1 because make didn't need to recreate the documentation
    completely.  On the autobuilders this was not the case.

subversion (0.29.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Force neon build dependancy and libsvn0-dev dependancy to libneon24.
    In reality neon 0.23.9 or greater will work, but since we need to 
    hard-code the version in the libsvn0-dev dependnacy it is simpler to just
    force libneon24. (closes: #206031)
  * Disable testsuite on archs where it has passed.
  * Remove unneeded, crufty shlibs.local.
  * Make debian/control read-only to discourage edits to it rather than
    debian/control.in. (closes: #211091)
  * Drop debhelper build dependancy back to >=3 so it is easier to 
    build the package on old systems.
  * Actually install NEWS.Debian rather than having it sit in the
    source package where no one can see it. (closes: #210684, #210822)
  * Update /etc/subversion/config and /etc/subversion/servers
  * Make package descriptions more clear and detailed. (closes: #210065)

    (closes: #158549).
  * Use /etc/subversion/config to give us proper editor behavior rather
    than patching the C source as I had when I closed Bug#157129.
  * Patch libsvn_subr so it respects /etc/subversion/config.

    - symlink config.{sub|guess} during build so they are always up to date.
      Add build-dep on autotools-dev.
    - Call autogen.sh when cleaning the tree.  Add versioned build-dep 
      on autoconf.

    (I do plan on making the python package like in subversion-snapshot 
    in the future but still need to figure some things out.)

subversion (0.14.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * some build fixes thanks to Jon Middleton <jjm@ixtab.org.uk>

    libsvn0-dev depends on extra libdb4.0-dev and policy forbids 
    binary dependancies on packages with lower priorities.
  * libneon build dep changed (libneon-dev -> libneon21-dev)
  * Conform to policy section 12.4 (Editors and Pagers) which states 
    that if the EDITOR variable is not set the program should use

    dependancy will be realized (for the most part) by way of libapr.

    is fixed, that will likely be the release after 2.0.37-2.
  * include selection from INSTALL in README.Debian
  * Make warnings in debian/control about this being in-development, 
    pre-alpha software more conspicuous.
  * Create /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dav_svn.{load|conf} symlinks in
    libapache-dav-svn.postinst if appropriate files exist in 
    /etc/apache2/mods-available.  Delete these links in
