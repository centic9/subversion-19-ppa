Subject: Change the ruby 'digest' typemaps to tolerate NULL pointers.

Bug #387996: I looked at the failing self tests [on m68k]. The first
one is a bug in the created wrapper. The basic problem is that in
svn_delta.c:_wrap_svn_txdelta_apply_wrapper() the value of temp3 is not
modified by svn_txdelta_apply_wrapper(), so the return is basically
random. In this case the stack is clear and svn_md5_digest_to_cstring()
returns a NULL, which rb_str_new2() doesn't like.

The easiest fix is to change the typemap in svn_types.swg so it can deal
with the NULL pointer. (BTW I tried returning Qnil here, but that
doesn't work well output_helper.)
